# Asal-Internship
I have successfully completed a 320-hour Front-End Development Internship at ASAL Technologies. This repository encompasses the tasks we worked on, including the code deployments for each task, along with detailed explanations about the tasks and the technologies utilized. Throughout the internship, I gained valuable experience working with a wide range of technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Gulp JS, ES6+, ReactJS, API integration, React Query, React Context, React Redux Toolkit, and MUI. These technologies enabled me to develop robust and responsive web applications, ensuring a seamless user experience.


## Albums Task5
Responsive React application that consumes the JSONPlaceholder Albums API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums). The application consists of three pages: a main page with infinite scrolling functionality, a search bar for filtering albums by title, and the ability to redirect to individual album pages (/albums/{albumId}). Additionally, there is an album page that displays all album images using infinite scrolling and a 404 page for non-existing album IDs. I followed the requirement of not using any CSS libraries and ensured full responsiveness across various devices. Axios was used to fetch data from the API. This project demonstrates my proficiency in consuming APIs, implementing infinite scrolling, handling routes, and creating responsive React applications.

## Albums Task6
This task is enhancing the previous task implementation with additional features. I integrated caching of fetched data using Redux Toolkit. This allows for efficient retrieval of previously fetched album data, reducing the need for repeated API calls. Furthermore, I implemented search history functionality using Redux Toolkit.

## GulpJS Task4
In this task, I create a responsive website. I designed and implemented four HTML pages with responsive styling using Bootstrap, ensuring optimal display on various devices. With the help of JavaScript, I achieved seamless page transitions, allowing users to navigate between pages without any interruptions. Furthermore, I implemented dynamic loading of HTML, CSS, and JS files based on the URL, resulting in improved performance by loading only the required resources. Leveraging Gulp.js, I automated the minification of HTML, CSS, and JS files, optimizing their sizes and enhancing the website's performance.

### Deployment:
I encountered a problem during the deployment of the project, but I am going to fix it as soon as possible.In the meantime, you can review the code provided above to get an understanding of the work accomplished.




## Task3 
In this task, I successfully implemented three responsive pages: sign-in, sign-up, and profile. The sign-in and sign-up pages allow users to enter their information and employ regex-based data validation to ensure the submission of valid data. The entered data is securely stored in the local storage. Users can navigate back and sign in using their registered credentials. The profile page displays the user's information, providing them with the ability to view and edit their details. Any changes made can be saved for future reference. The task involved HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create visually appealing and fully responsive pages, offering a seamless user experience.
